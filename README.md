## Airport System

# Overview

The Airport System is a Java-based application that integrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). It provides a complete solution for managing airport operations such as flight searches, ticket bookings, and reservation management. The system stores all data in an SQL database for persistence and reliability.

# Features

Flight Search: Search for available flights by destination, date, or time.

Ticket Booking: Book tickets for selected flights and store them in the database.

Reservation Management: View, modify, or cancel reservations with database-backed persistence.

User-Friendly GUI: Intuitive interface using Java Swing.

OOP Design: Modular, maintainable code using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

SQL Database Integration: Stores flights, passengers, tickets, and staff information securely in a relational database.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java

GUI Framework: Swing
